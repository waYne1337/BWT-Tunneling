/**
   The lower methods implement a lazy max heap.
   A lazy max heap is a heap that allows, additional to the operations on
   a normal heap, the decrease and removal of heaped elements. Unlike normal
   heaps, decreasing and removing elements will not take place immediately -
   instead, the user provides a function which indicates the state of an element.
   The respective element then will be heapified / removed as soon as it is required
   for a comparison to another element.
  
   The methods require following callback functions:
   - vstate: takes an element (maybe per reference) and returns its state:
             - lheap_vstate::unchanged
               indicates that value was not changed since last usage
             - lheap_vstate::decreased
               indicates that value was decreased and has to be heapified.
               Note that after the call, an additional call to the same value
               has to return lheap_vstate::unchanged.
             - lheap_vstate::empty
               value is no longer present and has to be removed from the heap.
             the default is a function that always returns lheap_vstate::unchanged.
   - comp: takes two elements from heap and returns true if the first element
           is smaller than the second. It is ensured that the state of each
           compared value is lheap_vstate::unchanged. Default for comp is std::less.
  
   Following methods are available:
   - make_lheap: construct the heap from a range of elements
                 (during construction, no values can be decreased)
   - pop_lheap_nomove: removes the first element and rebuilds the heap.
                       during this call, the state of variables will be checked
                       if necessary. Function returns the new ending position of
                       the new heap.
   - pop_lheap: removes the first element and rebuilds the heap.
                Additionally, the first element will be moved to the last
                position. Function returns the new ending position of
                the new heap.
                NOTE ON USAGE: be careful using this function when
                               elements of the heap are removed, as
                               the removed elements behind the heap not
                               necessarily need to be consecutive.
  
   Typical Usage:
   The typical usage of this methods is in situations where the removal of
   the maximal element in a heap causes side-effects on other elements which
   cause them to decrease their weight or even be removed completely.
  
   Example Usage: (requires vector from STL)

vector<int> A{ 10,20,30,5,15,1,1,7,1,3 };
make_lheap( A.begin(), A.end() );
auto vstate = []( int &i ) { 
	if (i > 0)	return lheap_vstate::unchanged;
	else if (i == 0) return lheap_vstate::empty;
	else {
		i = -i; //ensure value is correct after call
		return lheap_vstate::decreased;
	}
};
cout << "size of A: " << A.size() << endl << "A = {";
for (auto a : A) cout << "\t" << a;
cout << "\t}" << endl;

for (auto e = A.end(); e != A.begin(); e = pop_lheap_nomove(A.begin(), e, vstate)) {
	//output current maximum
	cout << A.front() << endl;
	//decrease a random variable from mid
	int i = (e - A.begin()) / 2;
	cout << "Decreasing value " << A[i] << " to half" << endl;
	A[i] = -(A[i] / 2);		
}
